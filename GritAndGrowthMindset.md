# Understanding Internal Locus of Control
## What is Internal Locus of Control?
The Internal Locus of Control refers to a belief that you - your own efforts, decisions and actions - are what shape the outcomes in your life.
People with high internal locus of control believe success or failure depends mainly on what they do, not on luck or external circumstances. 

## The Locus Rule
Staying motivated over time works much better if you adopt an internal locus of control.
When you see outcomes as within your control - and take responsibility for your efforts - you're more likely to stay motivated, persist through setbacks, and keep working toward your goals.

# How to build a Growth Mindset?
+ Believe in your ability to figure things out.
+ Question your assumptions (especially negative or limiting ones).

+ Honor the struggle - accept that growth involves struggle, failure, effort.
