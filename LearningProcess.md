## Feynman Technique
Explain a concept in simple, beginner-friendly terms to reveal gaps in your understanding.

## TED talk by Barbara Oakley
**Interesting Story**<br/>
For me, the most compelling idea was the **two-mode thinking** — especially that **letting your brain rest or “diffuse”** can be just as important as concentrated focus. It reframes breaks or downtime not as wasted time, but as **essential parts of learning**.

**Active Mode**<br/>
A highly concentrated, deliberate way of thinking is used when solving problems, studying, or paying close attention to something.

**Diffused Mode**<br/>
A relaxed, open, wandering type of thinking that occurs when your mind is at ease, allowing creative connections and deeper understanding to form.

## Steps to approach a New Topic
- Deconstruct the skill
- Learn enough to self-correct
- Remove practice barriers
- Practice for at least 20 hours

## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp
- Identify where each concept is used or applied before studying it.
- Explain the concept in your own words to check real understanding.
- Implement the concept in code or design to convert theory into skill.
- Rewrite concepts in your own style, diagrams, or mental models.
- Regularly teach the concept to someone else (or to an imaginary audience).
- Focus on mastering a few important skills deeply rather than trying everything.
- Review and reflect weekly: what you learned, what you struggled with, what to improve.
