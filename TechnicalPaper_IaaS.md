# IaaS

**What is IaaS?**<br/>
IaaS is an acronym that stands for **Infrastructure as a Service.**

**Infrastructure (I):** Refers to the underlying computer resources, which can be thought of as "some other dude's computer running somewhere else".

**As a Service (aaS):** Represents the billing and consumption method.

**How does it work?**\
Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers and data centers, you rent them from a cloud provider like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

**The Three Main IaaS Components**<br/>
Infrastructure primarily falls into three main categories,
* **Compute:** This is where the actual processing and "heavy lifting" occur, utilizing CPUs (Central Processing Units), GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), and HPCs (High-Performance Computing).
* **Storage:** Different types of storage, like Object Storage, Block & File Storage.
* **Network:** The piece that ties all components together, allowing compute to communicate with storage and other compute resources.

**The "As a Service" Consumption Model**<br/>
The "as a service" model is characterized by four main elements,
* **Shared:** Offerings are shared among many customers simultaneously, which helps keep the cost down.
* **Billing by Usage:** Customers are billed based on consumption, typically hourly or monthly.
* **No Contracts:** Customers don't have to commit to a set amount of time. They use the service for as long as needed and then stop, making it on-demand.
* **Self-Service:** Offerings are provisioned and delivered quickly, often in minutes or hours, through a self-service portal or website.
