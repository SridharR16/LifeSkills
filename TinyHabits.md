# Tiny Habits

## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
- Every morning when he got out of bed, he would say: “It’s going to be a great day.”
- This took only a second, but it boosted his mood and mindset.
- It became automatic because it was simple and tied to something he already did - getting out of bed.
- Lesson: Even emotional habits can be formed through tiny triggers and simple actions.


## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### B = MAP
- B = MAP means Behavior happens only when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt occur at the same moment - that’s the core of Fogg’s behavior model.

- M - Motivation:
How much you want to do the behavior. Higher motivation increases the chance the behavior will happen. 

- A - Ability:
How easy the behavior is to do. If something is very easy, it requires less motivation. Making a behavior tiny increases ability.

- P - Prompt:
The trigger that reminds or cues you to do the behavior. Without a prompt, the behavior won’t happen even if motivation and ability are high.

- You make habits easier by lowering barriers and designing prompts so that Ability is high and a prompt reliably cues the tiny action, therefore reducing reliance on fluctuating motivation. 

### Why celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
- Celebration creates the positive feeling BJ Fogg calls Shine - that immediate positive emotion strengthens the brain’s habit wiring.
  
- Shine reinforces the behavior neurologically - the positive feelings act like a reward, triggering your brain to encode and repeat the habit.

- Celebration increases the likelihood of repetition - when your brain feels good after doing something, it wants to do it again.

- It builds confidence and momentum - small wins make you feel capable, which motivates you to continue and even expand the habit later.

- Emotions (like shine) matter more than repetition alone - Fogg argues that without positive emotion, repetition doesn’t reliably form habits; emotion creates the habit.


## 1% Better Every Day Video

- The most interesting idea is the British Cycling “1% improvement” story, where tiny upgrades in many small areas led them from failure to world champions.

- James Clear explains that small improvements compound, just like interest in a bank - tiny gains add up to huge results over time.

- Improving 1% every day - 37× better in one year, showing the power of consistency.

- Small changes in your environment can automatically push you toward better habits without needing strong motivation.

- The Two-Minute Rule shows that starting small is enough - once you start, the habit naturally grows.


## Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Book’s Perspective About Identity
- The book argues that true behavior change comes from changing your identity, not just changing your actions.

- Identity-based habits focus on who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve.

- Every action you take is like a “vote” for the kind of person you want to be; habits reinforce identity over time.

- The more your habits align with your desired identity, the more automatic and lasting the change becomes.

### How the Book Says to Make a Habit Easier to Do
- Make it obvious by designing cues in your environment that remind you to do the habit.

- Make it attractive so you want to do the habit; pairing it with something you enjoy helps. 

- Make it easy by reducing friction - simplify the habit so it requires minimal effort.

### How the Book Says to Make a Habit Harder to Do
- Make it invisible - remove the cues that trigger bad habits from your environment. 

- Make it unattractive by reframing how you think about the habit’s downsides.

- Make it difficult - increase friction so doing the bad habit requires more effort or steps.


## Reflection

### Habit you want to do more of

- Make the cue obvious - Keep the book on your pillow or on your desk where you can see it immediately.

- Make it attractive - Pair reading with something enjoyable, like having tea or listening to soft background music.

- Make it easy - Start with the Two-Minute Rule - read just 2 pages a day to build consistency.

### Habit you want to eliminate

- Make the cue invisible - Keep your phone in another room or inside a drawer after 9 PM.

- Make it unattractive - Remind yourself of the negatives (poor sleep, wasted time) by writing a note near your bed.

- Make it hard - Log out of distracting apps or enable app timers so accessing them requires extra steps.
